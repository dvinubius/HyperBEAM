## üéØ Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Read the [Introduction to HyperBEAM](../introduction/what-is-hyperbeam.md)
2. Follow the [Interactive Tutorial](hyperbeam-interactive-tutorial.md) step by step
3. Bookmark the [Quick Reference](hyperbeam-quick-reference.md)

### For Experienced Developers
1. Skim the [Interactive Tutorial](hyperbeam-interactive-tutorial.md) for concepts
2. Use the [JavaScript Client Example](hyperbeam-client-example.js) as a starting point
3. Refer to the [Quick Reference](hyperbeam-quick-reference.md) as needed

### For Advanced Users
1. Explore the [device documentation](../devices/overview.md)
2. Study the [source code](../../src/) for implementation details
3. Consider building custom devices for your use cases

## üîß Prerequisites

- A running HyperBEAM node (local or remote access)
- Basic understanding of HTTP/REST APIs
- An AO process ID (if you want to follow the process examples)
- `curl` or your favorite HTTP client

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Test your setup:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:10000/~meta@1.0/info
   ```

2. **Try your first HyperPATH:**
   ```bash
   curl 'http://localhost:10000/~message@1.0?greeting=Hello&count+integer=42/greeting'
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive tutorial for more!**

## üí° Key Concepts

- **Messages**: Data structures that can contain functions and data
- **Devices**: Computational engines that process messages
- **HyperPATHs**: URLs that represent computation chains
- **Process**: Persistent, stateful execution environment
- **Patch Device**: Mechanism for exposing process state via HTTP
